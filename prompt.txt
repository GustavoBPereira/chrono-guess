`You will build a single-page frontend application that consumes a provided API for a game called Timeline.
This game is a very simple game, is similar to a quiz or something like wordle.

🧠 Game Concept

The game works as follows:

The player receives a historical event (a “card”).

The player must place this event in the correct chronological position in the timeline.

If correct:

The event is added to the timeline.

If incorrect:

The player loses one life.

In both cases:

The player receives a new card.ww

All game rules, validation, and state transitions are handled by the API.

The frontend must only consume the API and render the state accordingly.

This game state is based on:
```
"player_hand": [
    {
        "id": 15,
        "title": "The first public use of ether as an anesthetic",
        "summary": "William T.G. Morton made the first public demonstration of ether anesthesia at Massachusetts General Hospital.",
        "year": null
    }
],
"timeline": [
    {
        "id": 8,
        "title": "The invention of the printing press",
        "summary": "Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press with movable type around 1440, revolutionizing communication.",
        "year": 1440
    },
   {
        "id": 8,
        "title": "The release of python",
        "summary": "Guido van rosson realases frist version of Python prgramming language.",
        "year": 1995
    }
],
"remaining_deck": 13,
"remaining_life": 3,
"status": "ongoing"
```

API DOC

## Timeline Game API Documentation

   Domain = 127.0.0.1:8000

  This document outlines the API endpoints for the Timeline game, which will be used by the front-end application.

  1. Create a New Match

  Creates a new game match, initializes the deck, the player's hand, and the timeline.

   - Path: GET /api/match/
   - Method: GET
   - Payload: None

  ---

   - Success Response (200 OK):

      Returns a JSON object representing the initial state of the match.

    1     {
    2         "id": 1,
    3         "player_hand": [
    4             {
    5                 "id": 15,
    6                 "title": "The first public use of ether as an anesthetic",

   19             }
   20         ],
   21         "remaining_deck": 13,
   22         "remaining_life": 3,
   23         "status": "ongoing"
   24     }

      Response Fields:
       - id (integer): The unique identifier for the match.
       - player_hand (array): A list of "occurrence" objects the player holds. The year is hidden (null).
       - timeline (array): A list of "occurrence" objects already placed on the timeline. The year is visible.
       - remaining_deck (integer): The number of cards left in the draw deck.
       - remaining_life (integer): The number of incorrect guesses the player has left.
       - status (string): The current status of the match ("ongoing", "win", or "lose").

  2. Get Match Details

  Retrieves the current state of a specific match by its ID.

   - Path: GET /api/match/<match_id>/
   - Method: GET
   - Payload: None

  ---

   - Success Response (200 OK):

      Returns a JSON object with the same structure as the "Create a New Match" endpoint.

   1     {
   2         "id": 1,
   3         "player_hand": [ ... ],
   4         "timeline": [ ... ],

   6         "remaining_life": 2,
   7         "status": "ongoing"
   8     }

   - Error Response (404 Not Found):

      Returned if the match_id does not exist.

   1     {
   2         "error": "Not found"
   3     }

  3. Play a Card (Submit an Occurrence)

  Submits an occurrence (a card) from the player's hand to a specific position on the timeline. The server validates if the placement is correct.

   - Path: POST /api/match/<match_id>/
   - Method: POST
   - Payload:

      A JSON object containing the ID of the card being played and its target position on the timeline.

   1     {
   2         "occurrence_id": 15,
   3         "position": 1
   4     }
